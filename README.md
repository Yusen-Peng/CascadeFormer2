## NTU-AD

I propose that we can take NTU dataset (originally used for action recognition) and classify them into normal/abnormal actions, namely:

**48** normal actions:

```
A1. drink water; A2. eat meal/snack; A3. brushing teeth; 
A4. brushing hair; A5. drop; A6. pickup; 
A7. throw; A8. sitting down; A9; standing up (from sitting position);
A10. clapping; A11. reading; A12. writing; A13. tear up paper; 
A14. wear jacket; A15. take off jacket; A16. wear a shoe; 
A17. take off a shoe; A18. wear on glasses; A19. take off glasses; 
A20. put on a hat/cap; A21. take off a hat/cap; A22. cheer up; 
A23. hand waving; A24. kicking something; A25. reach into pocket; 
A26. hopping (one foot jumping); A27. jump up; 
A28. make a phone call/answer phone; 
A29. playing with phone/tablet; A30. typing on a keyboard; 
A31. pointing to something with finger; A32. taking a selfie; 
A33. check time (from watch); A34. rub two hands together; 
A35. nod head/bow; A36. shake head; A37. wipe face; 
A38. salute; A39. put the palms together; 
A40. cross hands in front (say stop);
A41. sneeze/cough; A49. use a fan (with hand or paper)/feeling warm; 
A53. pat on back of other person; A55. hugging other person; 
A56. giving something to other person; A58. handshaking; 
A59. walking towards each other; A60. walking apart from each other.
```

**12** abnormal actions:

```
A42. staggering; A43. falling; A44. touch head (headache); 
A45. touch chest (stomachache/heart pain); A46. touch back (backache); 
A47. touch neck (neckache); A48. nausea or vomiting condition; 
A50. punching/slapping other person; A51. kicking other person;
A52. pushing other person; A54. point finger at the other person; 
A57. touch other person's pocket.
```
